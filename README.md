## Problem 1: How to develop different apps in same project like server/nextjs and agent-server/nodejs
### I simple created two folders agent-server and server and install npm init -y in agent-server and npx create-next-app@latest in server. Then i cut .git and .gitignore as is and paste in the root and improved .gitignore.
